add a gh action with shellcheck (pilfer from Lokl-go repo)

failing tests:

 - [ ] given an input namespace, output namespace and a directory, it rewrites all instances within the dir matching our pattern.

Pattern to match should work on PHP docs examples, like:

```php
use My\Full\Classname as Another;
use My\Full\NSname;
use ArrayObject;
use function My\Full\functionName;
use function My\Full\functionName as func;
use const My\Full\CONSTANT;
use My\Full\Classname as Another, My\Full\NSname;
```

ie, `$use INPUTNAMESPACE ...;`

I don't expect use statements to break lines, so won't handle that to start.

- [ ] given an input repo user/name, output repo user/name and dir, will do bulk rewrites of that exact match in composer.json

This allows me to publish my rewritten fork to Packagist

 - [ ] given an input local filename, like `./templates/deletions/guzzle` and input dir, will remove all files/dirs from the repo that are specified in my template

Could put more effort in and have these templates contain all the rewriting recipes and pattern match, requiring *only* the target dir as input and it will figure out the rest

That's about all I need for now, I think.
